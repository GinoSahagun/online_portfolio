# My Online Portfolio

## Introduction
A few things about myself is being able to work in a field that can create anything. While Technology is a big part of my life, I enjoy exploring new tools by building websites, mobile apps, or even small personal apps. Some of my favorite languages to use are C++, Java, C#, and JavaScript. However, the idea of problem solving and finding an optimize solution is an unexplainable feeling that keeps me coding.

When I’m not coding much in Java or C++ or thinking of what to start next. I'm having a good time with mates and doing entertaining things like slaying dragons and what have you.
